Brief introduction to digital media
-----------------------------------

Digital Audio/Video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compared to the conventional tapes, they are convenient to store, share and
highly cost effective. The A/V data is stored in files with certain extensions. 
Example, mov, mp3, mpg, mp4, mkv etc.

Media compressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The raw media files are often considered good for video editing as they retain 
unaltered data from camera/microphone. However, the raw size could be in order 
of hundreds of GB for just an hour of 1080i video. This isnâ€™t suitable for 
transmission and storage. Hence, a compression on original data is applied 
according to the production house requirements. Most studio however prefer 
lossless compression. 

  	
Containers or Formats or Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The formats are often the extensions of the file, technically may be called 
as containers. We will use the term container henceforth. 
A container is a software wrapper which carries encoded A/V and its metadata. 

Codecs
~~~~~~

(Coder-Decoder) The compression of the data is crucial. There are several 
algorithms implemented to optimize the encoding and decoding process. However,
there are known tradeoffs, such as, a highly compressed file may require 
higher CPU while decoding, and so on. The selection of codecs is a thoughtful
process based on factors such as end user, bandwidth, quality, cost etc. 

Few popular codecs are h264, vp8, lame, DivX etc.

FFmpeg
------

A simple yet powerful cross platform, cross architecture, command line tool to record, convert and 
stream audio and video data. 
There are several projects which use **FFmpeg** in backend, an extensive list 
can be found `here.  <https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Projects>`_
